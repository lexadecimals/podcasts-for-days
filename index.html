          a radio show with all the fun and laughter left in and all the annoying music/commercials cut out. If you want to laugh like a maniac when riding the bus or walking down the street alone, there are no subsitutes. Start with the early stuff on
          Soundcloud before making your way through the BBC 6 Music podcasts on iTunes. Then, should you feel moved to do so, shout "Stephen!" at the top of your lungs in a crowded place. </p>

        <p><span class="podcast-title"><a href="https://serialpodcast.org/season-one" target="_blank">Serial: Season One </a></span> &#8226; The podcasting world can be divided into pre and post Serial. With this weekly (serial) true crime mystery, we undoubtedly
          reached PEAK PODCAST. Even my mother listened, and she doens't even understand what a podcast is. Sidebar: I prefered "spin-off" <a href="https://stownpodcast.org/" target="_blank"><em>S-Town</em></a> to Serial's second season, and higly recommend
          it (the less you know going in, the better).

          actor Wil Wheaton reads a haunting account of the 2013 dissapearance of Elisa Lam from the Cecil Hotel, California. The Cecil Hotel provided the inpsiration for <em>American Horror Story: Hotel</em>, and I listened this podcast hoping to be
          suitably spooked on Halloween. What I got was so much more. Wil Wheaton's voice is the perfect vessel for what is, ultimately, a heart-breaking tale. </p>
